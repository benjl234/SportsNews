            <p>Me puts things in their place and makes perspectives change. Just ask Steve Johnson, whose humility in recounting what he thought the first time he faced Jannik Sinner has left a truly funny anecdote symptomatic of the Italian's evolution. They faced off in Rome when the current number 1 was 17 years old, and the American had no inkling whatsoever of what was to come.

                There are stories we may never know that could not only amuse us but also illustrate how things can change rapidly. Jannik Sinner was never a diamond in the rough dominating the lower levels of Italian tennis, becoming a promise of the global sport. His emergence was abrupt, breaking into the Challenger circuit at 17 years old with unprecedented strength and quickly transitioning to the best tournaments in the world. Many wondered where this boy had come from, and some, like Steve Johnson, didn't even consider that he could become one of the best in the world.</p>

            <p>Jannik Sinner is also one of only two players to win both the ATP Finals and Next Gen Finals titles.
                Jannik Sinner making his way through the ranks to finish on top is one of the highlights of the 2024 season. He finished the year with eight titles and a 73-6 record, the most since Andy Murray won 78 matches in 2016. 
                
                The 2024 season was all about the Italian, as his successes this season heralded a change of the old guard. Sinner, the first from his country to become ATP World No. #1, can count two Grand Slams, the ATP Finals and the Davis Cap, among his exploits in 2024. Jannik Sinner and Stefanos Tsitispas are the only two players to have won the Next Gen Finals and the ATP Finals.</p>

            <p>Andy Murray will coach Novak Djokovic through to the Australia Open.
                November 23 marked the start of an unexpected partnership as the 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic joined hands with Great Britain legend Andy Murray, who only recently bid adieu to the sport post the Paris Olympics. Murray is expected to coach the Serbian at least till the next Australian Open in January 2025.
                
                Murray, 37, has had a stellar career marked by significant accomplishments, including winning three Grand Slam titles—Wimbledon (2013, 2016) and the US Open (2012)—and achieving the World No. #1 ranking in 2016. Additionally, he is a two-time Olympic singles gold medalist, triumphing at London 2012 and Rio 2016.

            <p>Team Canada, who earned their first victory when they lifted the trophy at the 2023 Billie Jean King Cup, travel to Malaga as the defending champions. The Canadians got the better of Italy 2-0 in Seville, Spain, for their maiden triumph.

                The Billie Jean King Cup 2024 was to get underway on November 13, with five-time champions Spain led by Paula Badosa to take on Team Poland with World No. #2 Iga Swiatek at the helm. Unforeseen weather conditions pushed back the opening tie between Spain and Poland to Friday, November 15.

                At the Billie Jean King Cup 2024 Finals, Japan and Romania will face each other for the first time in the competition’s history. Japan has reached the finals for the first time following a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan. The Romanians overcame Ukraine 3-2 to join Japan as first-time finalists at the team event. Japan will be without the services of four-time Grand Slam winner and former World No. #1 Naomi Osaka.
                
                The United States, with 18 titles under their belt, have not won a title since 2017, and their most recent appearance in a final was in 2021, where they lost to Czechia 2-1. The Czech team last won the trophy in 2018 and appeared in the finals of the 2022 and 2023 editions.
                
                Daniella Collins (USA) and Linda Noskova (Czechia) headline their respective sides as the two teams face off for the sixteenth time. USA leads 10-5 in their head-to-head</p>

            <p>Frances Tiafoe, usually a cool customer, courted controversy at the Shanghai Masters last month. The American directed verbal abuse at chair umpire Jimmy Pinoargote after losing the third-round match to Roman Safiullin. The trigger for the incident was a time violation warning on Tiafoe’s serve, with the score tied at 5-5 in the third set tiebreaker.

                Following his 7-5, 5-7, 6-7(5) loss to 61st-ranked Roman Safiullin, Tiafoe targeted the chair umpire in an expletive-filled rant. The Maryland native accused the official of stealing the match from him.</p>

            <p>The King of Clay featured in 30 Grand Slam finals.
                Rafael Nadal, also known as the King of Clay is a 22-time Grand Slam champion only behind Novak Djokovic (who has won 24 times) in men’s singles tennis history. The Spaniard has dominated the Roland Garros having won the French Open 14 times! Nadal and Roger Federer, both reached their peak at the same time and hence fought a series of Grand Slam finals until Djokovic burst into the act, resulting in the formation of the big three.
                
                Nadal’s last Grand Slam major victory came at the 2022 French Open when he beat Casper Ruud. The tennis legend reached the grand slam finals for the first time in 2005 at the same event.</p>

            <p>Federer had reached 31 Grand Slam finals in his career.
                Roger Federer was a wizard on the court, with more than a few tricks up his sleeve. He possessed an unmatchable aura that emanated whenever he walked out onto a tennis court. The Swiss maestro held in rapture those who turned up to watch him play.
                
                Federer continued to dazzle spectators over the course of his 24-year career with his overpowering forehand combined with an elegant backhand that was the best in the business which had aged like fine wine.</p>

            <p>USA was the first nation to win more than 10 Billie Jean King Cup titles.
                The Billie Jean King Cup (or the BJK Cup) began life as the Federation Cup in 1963. It transitioned to the Fed Cup in 1995 and, in September 2020, took on the name Billie Jean King Cup in honour of former World No. 1 Billie Jean King. The rebranding recognises Billie Jean King’s achievements as a player and role model who fought for equality in women’s sports.
                
                Billie Jean King Cup is the biggest women’s team event in tennis and is held every year in different locations. It is similiar to the men’s Davis Cup as the top players from all over the globe compete for their respective nations. Initially featuring only a handful of countries, it has grown into a global competition with more than 100 nations participating.
